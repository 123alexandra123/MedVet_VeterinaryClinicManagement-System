# Project Title  
**VETERINARY CLINIC MANAGEMENT SYSTEM**

## Description  
**MedVet** is an easy-to-use application developed in **Java** with a graphical user interface (GUI) for managing a veterinary clinic. The application features a user-friendly design and clear functionalities. It allows veterinarians to track the medical history and health issues of their animal patients, as well as to add, edit, and delete information about them. Each animal is linked to an owner, and when an animal is deleted, the corresponding ownerâ€™s data is also removed. Additionally, the application provides features to view and update the contact information of owners, ensuring accurate and easily accessible records.

The application uses **MySQL** for data storage and is integrated with **MySQL Workbench** for database design and management.

## Objectives  
- A graphical user interface that is intuitive and easy to use.  
- Clear management of animal and owner information (view/add/edit/delete).  
- Intelligent search filters for locating animal patients.  
- Data storage and processing using a database managed with **MySQL** and **MySQL Workbench**.
